# Frontend Implementation Summary

Due to the large number of files needed for a complete frontend, I'll create the remaining essential pages.
The subagent approach isn't working due to model configuration, so I'll provide the core implementation.

## Files to Create:

1. CatalogPage.js - Product listing with filters
2. ProductDetailPage.js - Single product view with order form
3. LoginPage.js - Authentication
4. DashboardPage.js - Admin dashboard  
5. InventoryPage.js - Inventory management (CRUD)
6. OrdersPage.js - Order management
7. UsersPage.js - User management (owner only)

## Quick Implementation Strategy:
- Use Tailwind for styling
- Basic forms with validation
- API integration via api/client.js
- Role-based UI rendering

I'll create simplified but functional versions of each page.
